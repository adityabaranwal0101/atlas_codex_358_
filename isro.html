          <h2><b>HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF ISRO</b></h2>
          <hr>
        
The Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR) was set up in 1962 by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on the suggestion of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai. Initially there was no dedicated ministry for the space programme and all activities of INCOSPAR relating to space technology continued to function within the DAE. IOFS officers were drawn from the Indian Ordnance Factories to harness their knowledge of propellants and advanced light materials used to build rockets. H.G.S. Murthy, an IOFS officer, was appointed the first director of the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station,where sounding rockets were fired, marking the start of upper atmospheric research in India.An indigenous series of sounding rockets named Rohini was subsequently developed and started undergoing launches from 1967 onwards. Waman Dattatreya Patwardhan, another IOFS officer, developed the propellant for the rockets.

          <h3><b>2. Key Milestones:</b></h3>
->1975: ISRO's first satellite, "Aryabhata," was launched, marking India's entry into space technology.
<br>
->1980s: ISRO developed its first indigenous satellite launch vehicle, the Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-3), and successfully placed satellites in orbit.
<br>
->1983: The Rohini series of sounding rockets were launched, marking a significant step in India's space research.
<br>
->1990s: India launched the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and developed the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) for placing satellites in different orbits.


<h3><b>3. Notable Missions and Achievements:</b></h3>
->Chandrayaan-1 (2008):* ISRO's first mission to the Moon, which helped discover water molecules on the lunar surface.
<br>
->Mangalyaan (Mars Orbiter Mission, 2013):* India's first interplanetary mission to Mars, making India the first Asian country to reach Martian orbit and at a remarkably low cost.
<br>
->Chandrayaan-2 (2019):* A more ambitious lunar mission aimed to explore the moon's south pole and conduct various experiments.


<h3><b>4. Recent Developments:</b></h3>

->2020s: ISRO continued to advance with successful satellite launches, working on plans for human spaceflight (Gaganyaan), and expanding its capabilities in satellite technology, including communication, remote sensing, and navigation systems.




ISRO has consistently showcased innovation, cost-effectiveness, and a commitment to space research, making significant strides in space technology and contributing to the world of space exploration
