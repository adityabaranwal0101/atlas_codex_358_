  <h3><b>Welcome: Exploring the Cosmos Through Space Missions</b></h3>
  <div id="intro1">
    Welcome to the Atlas Codex's Galactic Odyssey webpage, where we journey through the extraordinary exploration
    of the cosmos. Space missions, led by agencies like NASA and ISRO, have significantly deepened our
    understanding of the universe. These missions have uncovered the secrets of celestial bodies, probed 
    the possibilities of life beyond Earth, and provided us with a profound perspective on our own planet.
    Join us as we celebrate the pioneers of space exploration and their captivating missions, reminding us 
    of the endless wonders that lie among the stars.

          The station was designed between 1984 and 1993. Elements of the station were in construction 
          throughout the US, Canada, Japan, and Europe beginning in the late 1980s.
          The International Space Station Program brings together international flight crews, multiple 
          launch vehicles, globally distributed launch and flight operations, training, engineering, and
           development facilities, communications networks, and the international scientific research community.

          Chandrayaan-3 is a follow-on mission to Chandrayaan-2 to demonstrate end-to-end capability in safe landing and roving on
           the lunar surface. It consists of Lander and Rover configuration. It will be launched by LVM3 from SDSC SHAR, Sriharikota.
            The propulsion module will carry the lander and rover configuration till 100 km lunar orbit. The propulsion module has Spectro-polarimetry 
            of Habitable Planet Earth (SHAPE) payload to study the spectral and Polari metric measurements of Earth from the lunar orbit.

          <h3><b>Parker Solar Probe</b></h3>
          NASA's Parker Solar Probe will revolutionize our understanding of the Sun. The spacecraft is gradually 
          orbiting closer to the Sun’s surface than any before it – well within the orbit of Mercury. Flying into
           the outermost part of the Sun's atmosphere, the corona, for the first time, Parker Solar Probe is 
           collecting measurements and images to expand our knowledge of the origin and evolution of solar wind. 
           It also makes critical contributions to forecasting changes in the space environment that affect life
          and technology on Earth.
