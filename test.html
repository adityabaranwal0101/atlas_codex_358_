            <h3><b>HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF ISRO</b></h3>
            <hr>
                The Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR) was set
                 up in 1962 by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on the suggestion of
                  Dr. Vikram Sarabhai. Initially there was no dedicated ministry for 
                  the space programme and all activities of INCOSPAR relating to space
                   technology continued to function within the DAE. IOFS officers were
                    drawn from the Indian Ordnance Factories to harness their knowledge
                     of propellants and advanced light materials used to build rockets. 
                     H.G.S. Murthy, an IOFS officer, was appointed the first director of
                      the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station,where sounding rockets 
                      were fired, marking the start of upper atmospheric research in India.
                      An indigenous series of sounding rockets named Rohini was subsequently
                       developed and started undergoing launches from 1967 onwards. Waman 
                       Dattatreya Patwardhan, another IOFS officer, developed the propellant
                        for the rockets.
